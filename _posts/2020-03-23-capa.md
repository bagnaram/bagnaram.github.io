[JenkinsX](https://jenkins-x.io) is the next iteration of the Jenkins CI engine
that is geared towards a cloud-native kubernetes setting. Instead of the more
broad approach taken previously, JenkinsX focuses on Kubernetes native
continuous-integration by relying on an engine
[Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline#-tekton-pipelines) to define its
jobs and pipelines inside of kubernetes.

# Cluster-API AWS
I'm using CAPA [Cluster-API provider for
AWS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws) as my workload
Kubernetes cluster. I manage this cluster locally with a control plane defined
using Kind.

My workload CAPA cluster is configured with [Contour
Ingress](https://projectcontour.io) and a wildcard `*.example.com` domain that
points to the Envoy load balancer. This will be relevant when setting up
JenkinsX Ingress because JenkinsX uses Nginx by default, which will need to be
disabled.

Likewise with Contour, I have already installed upstream
[Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) via the upstream installation
docs. This means the bundled install of Tekton with JenkinsX will also be
disabled later in this guide. Both these decisions are due to personal
preference and to test integration and flexibility with existing installations
of ClusterAPI.

# Install JenkinsX via JXL
JenkinsX development is in-flux and in order to fully support necessary
components such as Helm v3. JenkinsX has a bleeding-edge baseline called
[JenkinsX Labs](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/labs/jxl/), or JXL. This is a separate
binary released independantly of JX. I have found out that installing JXL
bundles its own JX runtime inside. Therefore, if you are installing both, they
will exist independently.

The first step is to fetch JXL from the Labs [release
page](https://github.com/jenkins-x-labs/jxl/releases). Again, this is activly
developed, so your mileage may vary. I always grab the latest release. Untar the
binary and drop it into `~/bin` or wherever you drop userland binaries.

# Git Repositories
JenkinsX relies on version control to store not only application code, but also
release and installation information for JenkinsX itself. Therefore, it is
necessary to have an accessible git repository available for JenkinsX. I use
GitHub.

First, it is necessary to create a clone of the JenkinsX version repository.
This contains all the dependencies and their versions that are tested and
required for JenkinsX to function. It is recommended to clone this repo because
not environments will fall under the specified compatibility matrix. I am running
kubectl `v1.17.4` which is newer than the upper limit of `v1.17.0` required at
the time of writing.

1. Create a github repository called `jenkins-x-versions`
2. Clone the upstream repository locally
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-versions
   ```

3. Create a new upstream `remote` and for merging.
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<USERNAME>/jenkins-x-versions
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-versions
   ```
4. Fetch upstream
    ```bash
    git pull upstream master
    ```
5. Make any modifications to the versions. I updated the `upperLimit` of `packages/kubectl.yml` to something greater.
   ```
   version: 1.13.2
   upperLimit: 1.17.4
   gitUrl: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl.git
   url: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl
   ```
A second repository will be created for JenkinsX to use for your environment, but this will be done automatically with a robot account.

# Git Robot Account
As mentioned, a robot account is required for JenkinsX to manage its baseline. In Github, this account can simply be an API token associated with a user. This is how JenkinsX will maintain the state of your CI environment. It uses Helm charts to define all its components.

For my testing purpose, I will associate an API token with my regular github account. Normally you would create a separate robot account but it is only possible with GitHub enterprise.

1. Log into GitHub https://github.com/settings/apps
2. Select Personal Access Tokens
3. Create a token called `jenkinsx` with the permissions: `delete_repo, read:org, read:user, repo, user:email, write:repo_hook`

# Start JenkinsX Install
JenkinsX install is initiated with the a boot. This boots the repository up and generates the manifests associated with the environment.

1. 
   ```bash
   jxl boot create --version-stream-url https://github.com/bagnaram/jenkins-x-versions.git --domain example.com
   ```
2. Select the `kubernetes` provider
3. Cluster name. I call mine `capi-quickstart` to match the name used by the management cluster.
4. Git owner name will be the GitHub user ID. Mine is `bagnaram`
5. Comma separated git provider usernames. Here I also use `bagnaram` since I am only testing with a single user.
6. Confirm and if it asks you to upgrade the `jx` version, decline. The version bundled with `jxl` is adequate.
7. Confirm the git server, organization, and repository name. JenkinsX will create a repository called `environment-capi-quickstart-dev` because we named the cluster `capi-quickstart` This repository doesn't exist so when JenkinsX will prompt you to log into GitHub in order to create the repository.
   ```
   ? git server for the new git repository: https://github.com
   ? git owner (user/organization) for the new git repository: bagnaram
   ? git repository name: environment-capi-quickstart-dev
   checking git repository bagnaram/environment-capi-quickstart-dev exists on server https://github.com
   repository already exists at https://github.com/bagnaram/environment-capi-quickstart-dev
   pushed code to the repository
   
   to boot your cluster run the following commands:
    
   jxl boot secrets edit --git-url https://github.com/bagnaram/environment-capi-quickstart-dev
   jxl boot run --git-url https://github.com/bagnaram/environment-capi-quickstart-dev
   ```

When the steps complete, Jenkins will provide two commands that are necessary to finalize and deploy the installation. Run the following command to provision a secret that JenkinsX will use for GitHub.
   ```bash  
   jxl boot secrets edit --git-url https://github.com/bagnaram/environment-capi-quickstart-dev
   ```

1. The default Jenkins admin username can be used.
2. Enter a secure admin password
3. Pipeline bot Git username will be `bagnaram` for this example, because it uses the same github user.
4. Pipeline bot Git email address will be linked to an email address associated with that Git user.
5. Pipeline bot Git token will contain the token that was provisioned earler in the GitHub settings. You can also get an explanation by entering `?` in the prompt. Enter the token and confirm.

## Disable Bundled Nginx and Tekton

As mentioned earlier, JenkinsX bundles its own Helm-based installation of the
Nginx Ingress controller, and Tekton. I decided to supply my own installation of
both of these, so it needs to be disabled from the JenkinsX deployment manifest.
The `jx-apps.yml` file inside the JenkinsX environment repo contains the list of
Helm apps to deploy.

1. Check out the `environment-capi-quickstart-dev` repo and modify the `jx-apps.yml` to remove the `nginx-ingress` and `tekton lines`. It should be modified as follows:

   ```
  apps:
   - name: jenkins-x/jxboot-helmfile-resources
   - name: jenkins-x/nexus
   - name: jenkins-x/lighthouse
   - name: jenkins-x/chartmuseum
   - name: jenkins-x/jxui
   - name: repositories
     repository: ".."
   ```
2. Save & Commit the file.

## Deploy JenkinsX
Jxl includes a `boot run` command which runs the Helm deploy against the environment repository. Simply run the command that was supplied at the end of the `boot create`.
```bash
jxl boot run --git-url https://github.com/bagnaram/environment-capi-quickstart-dev
```

# Expose Jenkins UI
Create the following HTTP Proxy resource. HttpProxy objects are similar to exposed
Ingress routes, but allow for more fine-grained control over specific paths and
http options. The JenkinsX UI uses WebSockets for populating front-end content
which are not supported by plain Ingress in Contour. This is because http issues
an `upgrade` request when WebSocket traffic initiates, following a different
protocol. HttpProxy supports WebSockets.

```
apiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1
kind: HTTPProxy
metadata:
  annotations:
  name: ui
  namespace: jx
spec:
  routes:
  - conditions:
    - prefix: /
    enableWebsockets: true
    loadBalancerPolicy:
      strategy: Cookie
    services:
    - name: jxui
      port: 80
  virtualhost:
    fqdn: ui-jx.example.com
```

If everything binds appropriately the HttpProxy object should produce a `valid` status. 
```
archlinux% kubectl get httpproxy
NAME    FQDN                   TLS SECRET   STATUS   STATUS DESCRIPTION
nexus   nexus-jx.example.com                valid    valid HTTPProxy
```

# Testing locally
In my environment, I mentioned setting up an `example.com` domain on AWS. This
Route53 domain is local to the VPC that CAPA is installed to. I don't want to
pay for a public top-level domain so I resolve this domain locally to the VPC.
This means that records can only be resolved by machines inside this VPC, or
pointing to Amazon's DNS server. However we have an option to tunnel all local
traffic through a bastion that lives inside that VPC. This is done using a SOCKS
proxy. This is extremely useful, because it can also proxy DNS requests.

Set up a SOCKS proxy locally:
```
ssh -D 1337 -q -C -N ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -i ~/mbagnara-key.pem
```
This essentially sets up an HTTP proxy locally on `127.0.0.1:1337` in which we can route requests through. For more information, please refer to <https://github.com/bagnaram/personal-docs/blob/master/sections/socks.adoc>

Configure your browser to use this proxy and be sure to enable the `Proxy DNS` option.
