This weekend I decided to do another century ride on the cycle. I currently ride
an early 80s Panasonic Sport LX. This ride will take me through some beautifal
hilly areas in central Texas. This trip was a little different though. I've been
getting into botanising lately, and this trip was going to be a way to get out
and make some plant observations while on the bike ride. 

After listening to the podcast [Crime Pays but Botany
Doesn't](https://joeblowe.podbean.com/), I became inspired to become more
familiar with the landscape we live in. He makes some good points about the
natural beauty that is out there, and to use the app
[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). This is a great network of natural
photos with or without identification and the community can track and list
different species based on location. I installed the app and set off on this
cycle ride.
