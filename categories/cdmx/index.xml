Arrival in CDMX
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>My first day in CDMX was with our group and we planned a breakfast and a time to
explore a mercado called Mercado de Artisinal. We were staying in the Condesa
area near Chapultepec, which seems to be more of a classy part of the city but
it is divided by large boulevards with nice trees and paths. My friends and I
were headed towards El Centro, where the Artisinal market was. We would stop for
breakfast somewhere along the way. After journeying for a little while we
stumbled into a very home-like restaurant called Restaurant Meson Del Kajon.
This breakfast was a traditional meal of bread(pan) and various topping. I had
the huevos &amp;amp; mole and it was a nice hearty breakfast meal!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
After the meal we walked through the Artisinal Market. This place is a vast
marketplace with small vendors selling everything from pottery, to trinkets and
dishes. We split off and each of us explored the mercado. At this point it
started raining very hard and I wanted to pick out some house numbers made of
ceramic tile. these type of house numbers are famous and are a nice touch to add
onto your building. With the rain pouring harder, we decided to leave and head
back to our accommodation. At this juncture, I walked back and stopped in a nice
panaderia I found along the way back.&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>

Teoticuan Pyramids
&lt;/h2>
&lt;div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
&lt;p>We started this day very early because we would be taking a tour to the ancient
pyramids near Mexico City. The tour bus would meet us at 6:30AM and we would
journey to the pyramids and take a full tour in the morning before the place
would get too busy.&lt;/p>
