It was not your average MX trip either! We were going for the Gueleguetza festival in Oaxaca. This is the interior of the country and contains a rich culture. I had always known Oaxaca for the many agave that grow in the region, and being a center for Mezcal production. However after some initial research, I found the area to be very physically active and even boasts some of the top performing athletes including trail running.</div></br><div class="post-date dt-published">August 9, 2022</div></article><article class="post-list h-feed"><header class=post-header><h1 class="p-name post-title"><a class=u-url href=/posts/2022-08-13-mexico2/>Mexico Trip - Part 2 CDMX</a></h1></header><div class="content post-summary p-summary">Arrival in CDMX My first day in CDMX was with our group and we planned a breakfast and a time to explore a mercado called Mercado de Artisinal.

An Openshift project is simply a context associated with a particular namespace. However projects/namespaces can be switched and all subsequent commands will inherit that namespace scope. This saves me the trouble of attaching -n namespace to each and every command. I decided to write a quick and dirty ZSH plugin to take care of this by adding a kubectl project command.</div></br><div class="post-date dt-published">July 7, 2021</div></article><article class="post-list h-feed"><header class=post-header><h1 class="p-name post-title"><a class=u-url href=/posts/2020-12-01-keyboard/>Building a Keyboard From Scratch</a></h1></header><div class="content post-summary p-summary">This article was typed using the finished keyboard.

I currently ride an early 80s Panasonic Sport LX. This ride will take me through some beautiful hilly areas in central Texas. This trip was a little different though. I&rsquo;ve been getting into botanising lately, and this trip was going to be a way to get out and make some plant observations while on the bike ride.
