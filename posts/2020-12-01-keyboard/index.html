Mechanical keyboards are all the rage today. Having a solid typing experience
has never been as important to me as I have realized now. Often we are left to
our squishy laptop keyboards, and they do get the job done. However, recently I
have started to realize that a good keyboard is comparable to a good set of
tires for a car, or good running shoes. This is the peripheral we interface the
most as humans. Doesn't it make sense for this interface to not just be usable,
but also pleasant and ergonomic?</p>

This is where we begin an overview of my keyboard project called "Ocotillo".
This idea to build a fully-custom keyboard would re-invigorate my electrical
engineering skills and prove to be quite a therapeutic experience during the
quarantine. I started collecting research in the summer of 2020 and I made a few
early decisions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I would be using KiCad for the schematic capture, and PCB design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keyboard would have custom mechanical switches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would natively support the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard>DVORAK key layout</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

Schematic
</h3>
<div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3>
<p>
The journey begins with the design of the schematic. I stumbled across the <a href=https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide>ai03
PCB Designer</a>, which is a very thorough introduction to designing mechanical
keyboards using KiCad. This guide goes through all the nuts and bolts of setting
up a simple 4x4 key matrix from schematic to PCB. Do take a look at this.</p>
<p>
I ended up designing project this around the AVR architecture. Previously built
by Atmel before being acquired by Microchip, AVR has been a staple in my
educational lab experience. The Atmega32u4 provides plenty of I/O for a 60% key
design. (I had earlier wanted 75% but this was complicated by incorrectly
purchasing the wrong keycap set from KBDFans). I centered around this
architecture and iterated a few times until I determined I would build a 60%
keyboard with USB-C interface and a dedicated ISP programming interface. This is
a simple schematic and is further simplified by the examples given in the
datasheet.</p>
<figure>

<p>
After completing the schematic, it was time to decide on a few things. I was not
fully familiar with keyboard switch sizes and how they would be placed in the
completed product and if everything would fit. After researching a bit, I
decided to purchase the keycaps and switches next. This would prove useful
later, when I construct the PCB. I would physically lay out the keyboard to
determine a sizing that would fit, along with the help of the online <a href=http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/>Keyboard
Layout Editor</a></p>

<p>
By printing out PCB designs one-to-one on paper, I could lay out components on
the paper and see if measurements are correct.</p>

<p>
Taking the schematic over to PCB ended up being the most laborious exercise. I
ended up going through several iterations of this project. Ai03's guide was
another reference point. He also includes a set of KiCad custom libraries for MX
style switches which proved to be very useful. I also looked at other
open-source keyboard projects such as
<a href=https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline.>https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline.</a> I wanted to make sure everything
would be exactly right at this point. Once you send the PCB Gerber files over to
be fabricated, that's it so they better be right.</p>
<p>
Laying out the traces, vias, and components can be considered an art, however
quite mundane also. I had previously used Eagle PCB and before that [PCB
Artist](<a href=https://www.4pcb.com/free-pcb-design-software.html).>https://www.4pcb.com/free-pcb-design-software.html).</a> I had tried KiCad
early on and found it to be quite lacking in features and quite buggy. That has
all changed. After learning its shortcuts and also its library system, it has
proved to be a very worthwhile open-source tool. I ended up laying out the PCB
with ai03's MX library, and sourcing some of the other component libraries
directly from Mouser. Once I felt everything was ready, I exported Gerber files
and uploaded to <a href=https://jlcpcb.com/>JLCPCB</a>.</p>

Assembly
</h3>
<div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3>
<p>
Constructing the final product required me to assemble a BOM from all my
footprints. I decided to use the Mouser BOM tool because between them and
DigiKey, Mouser carried all my components. I ordered all passive components,
sockets, and the microcontroller from Mouser.</p>
<p>
My keycaps were purchased from KBDFans and I was happy to find uniform-profile
DSA keys in <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/dsa-profile/products/npkc-dsa-9009-pbt-keycaps?variant=31385567985803">this attractive style</a>. Uniform-profile keycaps are necessary when
using non-standard key layouts like DVORAK because you can place them anywhere.</p>
<p>
When the PCBs arrived, all components, mx switches, and stabilizers it was
finally time for the moment of truth to see if everything physically fit. It
did! So it was now time for the laborious yet somehow therapeutic process of
soldering all SMD parts, switches, and TQFP microcontroller with just a conical
soldering iron. At this point, having a flux pen is a must! Flux up the pads and
let the solder flow. For small SMD components, I used the "tack-and-set" method
where you tack one end of the component with solder to the board to keep it put.
Then, flow the other end while the first end while still warm and it will "slide"
into place.</p>

<p>
The TQFP was based on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PB0u8irn-4">Flux Glide</a> method. The most incredibly difficult part
was soldering the USB-C plug with its tiny pitch leads and through-hole leads.
After 3 or so attempts of failed bridging leads, I finally got some clean solder
joints. I don't suggest doing this by hand without flux, and a solder sucking
tool!</p>

<p>
The firmware for this project is based on the <a href=https://qmk.fm/>QMK Firmware</a> project which offers
an extensible framework for AVR-based keyboards. Because I provided this board
with a dedicated ISP programming interface, I will be able to use my AVR-ISP
mkII programmer to flash the device directly.</p>

The QMK firmware setup is very simple. I was able to set up my keyboard mapping
over a single evening.</p>
<p>
The process is as follows:</p>
<p>
Assign the keyboard rows and columns to the GPIO pins assigned to the microcontroller.</p>

Trial and Error
</h3>
<div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-3>
<p>
When flashing the board and powering the keyboard, I hooked it up and …
nothing. Something must be wrong. The ISP programming interface worked so I knew
the chip was healthy. After some tedious troubleshooting with my digital
multimeter, I found that my USB D+ and D- pins were open.(one of them was
shorted to ground it that pesky USB connector) I re-soldered the data pins and
also found a misaligned GPIO pin(incorrectly assigned to AREF) in the
microcontroller. I tacked a jumper wire to that and my RC oscillator on the MCU
finally worked! After messing with the fuse settings in the <a href=https://www.engbedded.com/fusecalc/>AVR Fuse Calculator</a>
I found the proper configuration for my 16MHz clock crystal. With that, the
device plugged into my PC and it finally was detected as an input device! It
works!</p>

All in all, I would say this first revision was a success. Yes, there was some
bodging done, but it still looks clean and I am happy with the final product. It
is great to finally have a native DVORAK keyboard I can use to become more
proficient. I have open-sourced this entire project, so take a look! I hope
others can get as much out of this hobbyist project that I have been able to!</p>
