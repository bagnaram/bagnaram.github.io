<h2 id=closing-remarks--wrap-up>Closing Remarks & Wrap-up</h2>
<p>I spent some of that flight writing up this blog post, listening to music, and
sleeping. It has been a fulfilling but tiring two weeks. I need some time to
process everything. As I write this memoir of such a life-changing trip, I
cannot but stop and think about what a blessing this opportunity was. The
ability to visit such a different place. The process of trusting despite the
unknown. I would have never thought of doing something like this on my own in
my past. But, hey, sometimes that trust in something outside of yourself is
what gets you through. In my case, my faith and beliefs in Jesus Christ,
coupled with support from friends and family made this trip possible. This has
been a life-changing experience, and the context change has really given me an
opportunity to evaluate my own life and think about things in an entirely
different perspective. Coming to a greater appreciation of humanity and
differences in culture. Learning (or attempting to start) a new language
Vietnamese has been a challenge, but I learned so much from my 1 week in
country. If anything, it confirms the test. Attempt to learn the language of
where you are visiting for a much more fulfilling trip!</p>
<p>I continue learning vietnamese little by little. It might look like I did not
have much of a plan but who cares? I have meet 3 wonderful families who
graciously invited me on their adventures. I might have missed Ha Giang and
other destinations but I managed to avoid the major tourist spots and have had a
truly authentic trip! In fact I met very few foreigners my entire trip. Instead
of being a tourist, i was treated like family for the little Vietnamese I know.
Oh and the tr√°i c√¢y was everywhere! What a truly charming time. A+ would visit
again!</p>
<p>I hope this story encourages you to do something the same. Step out of your
comfort zone. Try something new, explore, and learn about yourself. This is the
theme of the trip, and you will make some new friends, discover yourself, and
possibly do something like this again in the future!</p>

<p>Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy. Because it is a lot more
efficient than traditional study methods, you can either greatly decrease your
time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. AnkiDroid is the
Android port of Anki, and is compatible with Anki data.</p>
