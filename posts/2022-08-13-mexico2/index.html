explore a mercado called Mercado de Artisinal. We were staying in the Condesa
area near Chapultepec, which seems to be more of a classy part of the city but
it is divided by large boulevards with nice trees and paths. My friends and I
were headed towards El Centro, where the Artisinal market was. We would stop for
breakfast somewhere along the way. After journeying for a little while we
stumbled into a very home-like restaurant called Restaurant Meson Del Kajon.
This breakfast was a traditional meal of bread(pan) and various topping. I had
the huevos & mole and it was a nice hearty breakfast meal!</p><p>After the meal we walked through the Artisinal Market. This place is a vast
marketplace with small vendors selling everything from pottery, to trinkets and
dishes. We split off and each of us explored the mercado. At this point it
started raining very hard and I wanted to pick out some house numbers made of
ceramic tile. these type of house numbers are famous and are a nice touch to add
onto your building. With the rain pouring harder, we decided to leave and head
back to our accommodation. At this juncture, I walked back and stopped in a nice
panaderia I found along the way back.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>Teoticuan Pyramids</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>We started this day very early because we would be taking a tour to the ancient
pyramids near Mexico City. The tour bus would meet us at 6:30AM and we would
journey to the pyramids and take a full tour in the morning before the place
would get too busy.</p><p>As we arrived, the morning sky was dotted with many hot-air balloons. It appears
that separate tours are available to take you up to see the pyramids from great
heights! As we unloaded and entered the park, we saw the pyramid scene for the
first time. These were built over the course of hundreds of years with varying
layers and Adonis over the years, displaying a sort of shell of pyramid layers.
They were magnificent and the Sun and Moon pyramids dominated the scene. It was
fun to imagine thousands of people walking the plazas and living in this space
as it was so peaceful to see in the morning. Shortly the crowds arrived and
changed the feel of the place. But in a good way, because it gave a bustling and
city feel to the area. As we toured these ruins, the guide explained some of the
history including the Aztecs finding this ancient civilization seemingly
abandoned. Then the Spanish entering and making their print on the place.</p><p>After the tour we had lunch at a restaurant on the grounds of the park area with
some live mexican Norteno music which made a great scene! After we finished we
reached back to CDMX and the rest of the day was open for me. My friends would
be having dinner at a chef's tasting, but I opted to free my time and try out a
famous al pastor taco place. This place was an automotive garage during the day,
and served street tacos at night. The ultimate and unlikely combination that I
had to try. It was about an hour walk from our accommodation in Candenza, and I
wanted to walk around and see some of the city as well. A nice walk later, I
found some of the most delicious al-pastor at the walk-up restaurant called Mi
Familia. It did not disappoint, with flavorful meat and salsas to top the tacos!</p><p>I walked back and stopped at a nice mezcaleria called Neicos. This place was one
of my highlights. I stumbled into the place and met some incredibly nice and
hospitable folks there. What a nice place to become a regular. What appears like
a liquor store on the bottom level, a staircase leads you to a middle level
mezcal bar, and rooftop on the 3rd level. I would make this mezcaleria a regular
stop during my time in CDMX!</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>Mercados</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>The next day my friends and I would explore Mercado Sonora in CDMX. We planned
the journey over cafe at a place nextdoor to our accommodation with a very
friendly owner. Mercado Sonora isn't the place for everyone. If you are
sensitive to animal treatment including tight spaces and cages I would skip this
one. We mainly went to this mercado to see some of the new-age and religious
items for sale. These include incense, paper masks, and an assortment of bootleg
dollar store items. As a cartoon fan, we saw many un-sanctioned Sonic the
Hedgehog merchandise that I could not resist. At this market one of my friends
experienced our closest shady moment in which she was given change from a vendor
containing a counterfeit bill. We only discovered this after she attempted to
make a purchase with one of the bills.</p><p>After exploring Sonora, we ventured to an adjacent Mercado de la Merced that was
more of a household goods and street food market. This place was massive. If you
get a thrill of feeling lost in a seemingly endless labyrinth of marketplace
vendors in a tight space, this is the place for you! I fall into this category
and quickly went into sensory overload with the sheer size of the place. We were
on the hunt for Pazole. This is a soup like thing served on only the weekends.
It contains bone broth, vegetables and maiz. We searched and searched and
eventually found a place called Cocina Frida. Very tasty and flavorful!
Afterwards we exited the chaotic market and a friend bought some chicharrones
and we headed to the Zocolo area.</p><p>Zocolo was the main town square with the chucrh and main city plaza. The
architecture is incredible in the region. Here you can clearly see the
construction made from volcanic stone for the buildings. We explored some of the
buildings, walked the city streets and even visited a mercado with some famous
exotic animals and insects.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-4>Last(maybe) Day</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-2><p>This day was supposed to by my last for the trip but unfortunately due to a
travel agency mishap, the trip got extended. For better or worse I found myself
with an extra week in CDMX. This was also partly due to the fact that my pet
sitter was still staying in my house so I didn't really have anyplace to go back
to just yet.</p><a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/1KpL2u43AqWh2cXbA><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEX3nQWZspMytiKwVo6dl7Fdm2P342LHhxRuxmtojf1F1NFCDHcffkHFYDDJyqwp356C6lYzl8eOUnfBDr0Cq99oJzHVa6YwvxauTbHxiH382kOVioW8u4wwOx4iDTkSwrtyMcTiWbBEG6JtIPyEzYH2=w1170-h877-no?authuser=0" alt=Welcome class=inline></a></div></div></div></article></main><footer class=common-footer><div class=common-footer-bottom><div class=copyright><p>© bagnaram 2022<br></p></div><ul class=social-icons><li><a href=https://github.com/bagnaram title=Github rel=me><span class=inline-svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 496 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6.0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6.0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3.0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1.0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4.0.0-70 15-84.7-29.8.0.0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6.0.0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4.0.0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5.0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9.0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4.0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6.0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6.0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9.0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"/></svg></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?user_id=mbagnara" title="I naturalist" rel=me>🍃</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhnNw_9b4ys6jJcBM_hkuw title=Youtube rel=me><span class=inline-svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 576 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M549.655 124.083c-6.281-23.65-24.787-42.276-48.284-48.597C458.781 64 288 64 288 64S117.22 64 74.629 75.486c-23.497 6.322-42.003 24.947-48.284 48.597-11.412 42.867-11.412 132.305-11.412 132.305s0 89.438 11.412 132.305c6.281 23.65 24.787 41.5 48.284 47.821C117.22 448 288 448 288 448s170.78.0 213.371-11.486c23.497-6.321 42.003-24.171 48.284-47.821 11.412-42.867 11.412-132.305 11.412-132.305s0-89.438-11.412-132.305zm-317.51 213.508V175.185l142.739 81.205-142.739 81.201z"/></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><p class="h-card vcard"><a href=https://bagnaram.github.io/ class="p-name u-url url fn" rel=me>bagnaram</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
