explore a mercado called Mercado de Artisinal. We were staying in the Condesa
area near Chapultepec, which seems to be more of a classy part of the city but
it is divided by large boulevards with nice trees and paths. My friends and I
were headed towards El Centro, where the Artisinal market was. We would stop for
breakfast somewhere along the way. After journeying for a little while we
stumbled into a very home-like restaurant called Restaurant Meson Del Kajon.
This breakfast was a traditional meal of bread(pan) and various topping. I had
the huevos & mole and it was a nice hearty breakfast meal!</p><p>After the meal we walked through the Artisinal Market. This place is a vast
marketplace with small vendors selling everything from pottery, to trinkets and
dishes. We split off and each of us explored the mercado. At this point it
started raining very hard and I wanted to pick out some house numbers made of
ceramic tile. these type of house numbers are famous and are a nice touch to add
onto your building. With the rain pouring harder, we decided to leave and head
back to our accommodation. At this juncture, I walked back and stopped in a nice
panaderia I found along the way back.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-2>Teoticuan Pyramids</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-2><p>We started this day very early because we would be taking a tour to the ancient
pyramids near Mexico City. The tour bus would meet us at 6:30AM and we would
journey to the pyramids and take a full tour in the morning before the place
would get too busy.</p><a href=https://photos.app.goo.gl/1KpL2u43AqWh2cXbA><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AL9nZEX3nQWZspMytiKwVo6dl7Fdm2P342LHhxRuxmtojf1F1NFCDHcffkHFYDDJyqwp356C6lYzl8eOUnfBDr0Cq99oJzHVa6YwvxauTbHxiH382kOVioW8u4wwOx4iDTkSwrtyMcTiWbBEG6JtIPyEzYH2=w1170-h877-no?authuser=0" alt=Welcome class=inline></a></div></div></div></article></main><footer class=common-footer><div class=common-footer-bottom><div class=copyright><p>¬© bagnaram 2022<br></p></div><ul class=social-icons><li><a href=https://github.com/bagnaram title=Github rel=me><span class=inline-svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 496 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M165.9 397.4c0 2-2.3 3.6-5.2 3.6-3.3.3-5.6-1.3-5.6-3.6.0-2 2.3-3.6 5.2-3.6 3-.3 5.6 1.3 5.6 3.6zm-31.1-4.5c-.7 2 1.3 4.3 4.3 4.9 2.6 1 5.6.0 6.2-2s-1.3-4.3-4.3-5.2c-2.6-.7-5.5.3-6.2 2.3zm44.2-1.7c-2.9.7-4.9 2.6-4.6 4.9.3 2 2.9 3.3 5.9 2.6 2.9-.7 4.9-2.6 4.6-4.6-.3-1.9-3-3.2-5.9-2.9zM244.8 8C106.1 8 0 113.3.0 252c0 110.9 69.8 205.8 169.5 239.2 12.8 2.3 17.3-5.6 17.3-12.1.0-6.2-.3-40.4-.3-61.4.0.0-70 15-84.7-29.8.0.0-11.4-29.1-27.8-36.6.0.0-22.9-15.7 1.6-15.4.0.0 24.9 2 38.6 25.8 21.9 38.6 58.6 27.5 72.9 20.9 2.3-16 8.8-27.1 16-33.7-55.9-6.2-112.3-14.3-112.3-110.5.0-27.5 7.6-41.3 23.6-58.9-2.6-6.5-11.1-33.3 2.6-67.9 20.9-6.5 69 27 69 27 20-5.6 41.5-8.5 62.8-8.5s42.8 2.9 62.8 8.5c0 0 48.1-33.6 69-27 13.7 34.7 5.2 61.4 2.6 67.9 16 17.7 25.8 31.5 25.8 58.9.0 96.5-58.9 104.2-114.8 110.5 9.2 7.9 17 22.9 17 46.4.0 33.7-.3 75.4-.3 83.6.0 6.5 4.6 14.4 17.3 12.1C428.2 457.8 496 362.9 496 252 496 113.3 383.5 8 244.8 8zM97.2 352.9c-1.3 1-1 3.3.7 5.2 1.6 1.6 3.9 2.3 5.2 1 1.3-1 1-3.3-.7-5.2-1.6-1.6-3.9-2.3-5.2-1zm-10.8-8.1c-.7 1.3.3 2.9 2.3 3.9 1.6 1 3.6.7 4.3-.7.7-1.3-.3-2.9-2.3-3.9-2-.6-3.6-.3-4.3.7zm32.4 35.6c-1.6 1.3-1 4.3 1.3 6.2 2.3 2.3 5.2 2.6 6.5 1 1.3-1.3.7-4.3-1.3-6.2-2.2-2.3-5.2-2.6-6.5-1zm-11.4-14.7c-1.6 1-1.6 3.6.0 5.9 1.6 2.3 4.3 3.3 5.6 2.3 1.6-1.3 1.6-3.9.0-6.2-1.4-2.3-4-3.3-5.6-2z"/></svg></span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?user_id=mbagnara" title="I naturalist" rel=me>üçÉ</a></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRhnNw_9b4ys6jJcBM_hkuw title=Youtube rel=me><span class=inline-svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 576 512"><path fill="currentcolor" d="M549.655 124.083c-6.281-23.65-24.787-42.276-48.284-48.597C458.781 64 288 64 288 64S117.22 64 74.629 75.486c-23.497 6.322-42.003 24.947-48.284 48.597-11.412 42.867-11.412 132.305-11.412 132.305s0 89.438 11.412 132.305c6.281 23.65 24.787 41.5 48.284 47.821C117.22 448 288 448 288 448s170.78.0 213.371-11.486c23.497-6.321 42.003-24.171 48.284-47.821 11.412-42.867 11.412-132.305 11.412-132.305s0-89.438-11.412-132.305zm-317.51 213.508V175.185l142.739 81.205-142.739 81.201z"/></svg></span></a></li></ul></div><p class="h-card vcard"><a href=https://bagnaram.github.io/ class="p-name u-url url fn" rel=me>bagnaram</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
